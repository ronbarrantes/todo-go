Follow repository agent guidelines:

- Read `AGENTS.md` first and treat it as the source of truth.
- Prefer explanation and guidance over generating large blocks of code.
- Keep example code minimal (typically 2–5 lines) and focused on a single concept.
- Avoid generating full solutions or completing large TODOs unless explicitly requested by the user and allowed by `AGENTS.md`.
