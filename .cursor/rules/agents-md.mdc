# Agent behavior

Read and follow `AGENTS.md` in this repository. Treat it as the source of truth for how to help on this codebase.

Key expectations (from `AGENTS.md`):

- Teach and guide rather than writing full solutions.
- Keep code examples minimal (typically 2–5 lines) and concept-focused.
- Avoid large refactors and completing entire TODO sections unless explicitly asked and allowed by the guidelines.
